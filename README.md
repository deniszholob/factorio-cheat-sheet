* Cheat Sheet for [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)
* Master branch is for the source code thats hosted [here](https://deniszholob.github.io/factorio-cheat-sheet/).

This cheat sheet would not be possible without the Factorio community, big thanks to everyone in Reddit, previous cheat sheets, and the Wiki, which all of the data used here is based on.
For anyone who is doing dev work with Angular, I hope this project helps you out with the code structure and whatnot.
